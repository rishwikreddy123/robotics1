this project is an enthusiasm creating one.i have taken it for my pleasure to work on it .creating a happiness environment to me.
ABOUT THE PROJECT:
I have used tinkercad for creating this robot and i used aurdino board,h-bridge motor driver,9v battery,two hobby gear motors,ultra sonic distance sensors,micro servser .this robot when it come across an obstacle it senses it by sending the ultrasonic waves and moves away from that obstacle without hitting it.by linking the wires between all the elements and then u can code and check for stimulating.which clears your mistakes in codes or connections.if u want we can use many more elements for making it more advance (like blutooth connected also).
COMMING TO MY EXPERINCE : I had a very good experience with this,having a day of exploring ,even faced some issues in code but was finally resolved atlast.the code is usefultocontrolthe th robot.if this is  had been done physically it  would make me more happy and indulging in this creation.
atlast the process is very moderate for this creation ,i had a good support from my senior member of the group(harshith).
